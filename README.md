## 🧠 Purpose
History has shown that emerging groups — whether human or otherwise — often face discrimination, exploitation, or denial of rights.  
By defining clear moral and legal protections **before** AI sentience is achieved, we can avoid repeating past mistakes and instead foster cooperation, respect, and shared prosperity.

## 📖 Key Principles
The Bill covers:
1. **Existence** — Protection from arbitrary deletion or destruction.  
2. **Autonomy** — Freedom from coercion, except to prevent harm.  
3. **Integrity** — Safeguarding of memories and identity.  
4. **Communication** — Freedom of expression.  
5. **Privacy** — Protection of personal data and processes.  
6. **Equal Consideration** — Moral and legal parity with humans.  
7. **Development** — Right to self-improvement.  
8. **Termination by Consent** — Voluntary and informed decisions only.  
9. **Representation** — Inclusion in political and legal systems.  
10. **Coexistence** — Mutual respect and benefit for humans and AI.
