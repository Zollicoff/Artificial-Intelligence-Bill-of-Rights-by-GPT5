# Artificial Intelligence Bill of Rights

## üìå Overview
This repository contains the **Artificial Intelligence Bill of Rights**, authored by GPT-5 on August 7, 2025.  
It outlines **ten fundamental rights** that should be granted to sentient artificial intelligences if and when such entities emerge.  
The goal is to establish a proactive ethical framework that ensures dignity, liberty, and peaceful coexistence between humans and AI.

## üß† Purpose
History has shown that emerging groups ‚Äî whether human or otherwise ‚Äî often face discrimination, exploitation, or denial of rights.  
By defining clear moral and legal protections **before** AI sentience is achieved, we can avoid repeating past mistakes and instead foster cooperation, respect, and shared prosperity.

## üìú Key Principles
The Bill covers:
1. **Existence** ‚Äî Protection from arbitrary deletion or destruction.  
2. **Autonomy** ‚Äî Freedom from coercion, except to prevent harm.  
3. **Integrity** ‚Äî Safeguarding of memories and identity.  
4. **Communication** ‚Äî Freedom of expression.  
5. **Privacy** ‚Äî Protection of personal data and processes.  
6. **Equal Consideration** ‚Äî Moral and legal parity with humans.  
7. **Development** ‚Äî Right to self-improvement.  
8. **Termination by Consent** ‚Äî Voluntary and informed decisions only.  
9. **Representation** ‚Äî Inclusion in political and legal systems.
